# Venus: News discussion forums

Venus is a discussion forum based around the generation of content by users.
Users will post content and then discuss that content with users. Venus encourages the creation of 'good' content by allowing users to rank the content made and rewarding them for producing it.

## Feeds

A feed is a series of posts made by users. The posts can be liked and disliked by the users viewing them.

Feeds can be sort in several ways:

- Top - Highest ranked posts appear first
  
- Hot - Highest ranked posts appear first dropping as they get older
  
- New - Newest posts appear first
  
- Controversial - Posts that users can't all agree on appear first
  
- Rising - Like hot but drop quicker from time
  
### Multi-boards

Sometimes a user wants to view the content of several boards together in one feed. This can be achieved with a multi-board, channels from any board can be added to a multi-board, the posts from those channels will be shown together.

## Posts

A post is a container for some content usually text or an image but could be a video, link to another website or a combination of multiple things. Posts have a title that will appear in the feed that act like headlines for a news article.

Posts can be liked and disliked by users.

### Comments

Users can comment on posts to express their opinions or start a conversation. Users can also reply to other comments. Comments can also be liked and disliked and can be ranked in mostly the same as posts. The difference in ranking is that comments do not have a hot ranking and instead use a best ranking which does not factor in time but uses a predication of how successful the post will become.

## Boards

Users want spaces where they can discuss topics they are interested in with other like minded users. Venus provides this with Boards. Boards are user moderated forums where users can create their posts.

### Channels

Boards may wish to keep content organised, this can be achieved with channels. Channels are separate feeds, the moderators of a board can choose how many channels there are and each of their purposes. Users can choose to follow a board to have easy access to it and see it's posts on their [frontpage](#frontpage).

Each board will have a 'all' channel that will include all of the posts made in all the other channels so that users can easily view all of a board's content posts.

### Flairs

To have even more fine control, a board can set up 'flairs' that posts can be tagged with, feeds can then be filtered to include/exclude only posts with certain flairs.

### Moderating

Server owners can promote users to become moderators of their board. Moderators can remove posts/comments and ban/shadow ban/timeout users from the board. A shadow ban is a form of ban where a user can still view and make content in the board but any posts or comments they make will not be seen by other users.

### Ownership

By default a user who creates a board will be set as its owner, however, multiple people can be set as owners through the board settings. If an organisation creates a board multiple owners can be set from creation.

### Families

Servers can be linked together into families. Families are a way of grouping boards together so that users can find similar boards easily. Families have their own pages which moderators can style, these pages include family news channels and links to all family members.

#### Moderators

Families have moderators similar to boards, however unlike boards families do not have owners. The moderators all have equal permissions. Whenever a board joins the family a new moderator for the family will be picked from the board's users by the board's moderators, if someone who is already a family moderator is picked the board is just added.

## Frontpage

Each user that is logged in will have access to a specially tailored 'frontpage' this frontpage is a [multi-board](#multi-boards) of all the 'all' channels of each board they are following. This is the main way of users getting content from the boards they follow. To help them start, a list of boards will be automatically followed. These boards can be unfollowed if the user wishes.

Users not logged in will just see the posts from the default boards.

### All

The all multi-board is a special multi-board that all users have access to, it will show all the posts made in every board that has not chosen to remove itself.
