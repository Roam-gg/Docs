# Terra: Social Media Platform

Terra is a social media platform based around building and allowing communication between friends and family. Users will be able to post updates on their feed which will be visible by anyone they've friended.

## Accounts

Roam has different account types which will allow users to easily distinguish between organisations, people and bots.

- Person - For the average user.

- Organisation/Brand - For brands, will have a [page](#Page) automatically created and will not have a profile. No ability to make friends.

- Bot - Bot accounts will be marked specifically. They will have an information page and not a profile.
  
### Verified

Verified is a special status that accounts for recognised celebrities and brands will be given so users can ensure the user they are following is the real person/brand.

### Page

A page works similarly to a profile however they can be customised to show a link to a chosen website and can only be followed not befriended.

## Timeline

A users timeline will be a collection of every status update they have created sorted by time.

### Status Update

A status update is a post created by a user. Like with Venus these posts can consist of text, images and videos, however, unlike Venus created posts will only be viewable by friends, or friends of friends as determined by the users privacy settings.

Status updates can be liked or disliked, commented on and reacted to.

## Feed

A users feed is the collection of all recent posts created by users who they are friends with.

## Stories

Users will be able to take photos and add them to their 'story'. Photos within a story will be deleted after 24 hours.

## Groups

Groups act as a place where users can come to talk about specific topics with people they otherwise wouldn't be in contact with. Groups can create and invite users to [Events](#Events).

## Astral Projection

Astral Projection is a camera function that allows two users to take an image together when they are not in the same location.

## Luna

Luna is a microblogging feature of Terra. Users will be able to view a second feed that is seperate from their main feed. Within this feed only posts created by users and brands, that have been followed, will appear.
