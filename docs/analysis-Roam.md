# Roam

Roam is a social media platform that brings personal social media, forum based social media and instant messaging together. Roam functions by using three windows that can be manipulated as the user wishes.

## Three Window Structure

The main webpage of Roam will be split into three windows. By default when a user opens [Terra](analysis-Terra.md), [Venus](analysis-Venus.md) or [Mercury](analysis-Mercury.md) it will be displayed over the entire page, taking up all three windows. A user can then reduce it to 2 or 1 windows, which will make it take up 2/3 or 1/3 of the page, and then open another service in another window if they wish.

## Accounts

Every user on Roam will have a personal account.

### Multi-Account

Users will be able to create multiple accounts. Users will be able to quickly switch between accounts from within the website.

Users will also be able to set default accounts for individual services.

### Bots

All services within Roam will support bot accounts. These accounts will be marked clearly so they cannot inpersonate real people.

## Leveling

When you create posts in either Venus or Terra other users will be able to vote on them. All votes for a user will be accumulated and displayed on their account. Earning these will also allow users to increase in rank, as a user increases in rank they will gain access to special borders for their profile pictures, themes for Roam and other such rewards.

### Theater Levels

Theaters will also be able to to accrue levels through the cumulative voting of its entire user base. Theaters will unlock similar rewards as users as they increase in levels.
